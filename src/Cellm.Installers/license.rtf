\pard\sa100\sl240\slmult1\cf1\b\f0\fs22 TERMS OF SERVICE\par
\b0\fs18\par
Please read these Terms of Service (the "Terms" or "Agreement") carefully. This Cellm Services Agreement is a legal agreement between \b Token Factory ApS\b0  ("Token Factory ApS", "Cellm", "us", or "we"), a company incorporated in Denmark, and the entity or person ("Customer", "you", "your", or "user") who registered on the Cellm Account page or otherwise accesses or uses the Services to receive certain software services, and other related business services offered by Cellm (each, a "Service").\par
\par
This Agreement describes the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services. We provide a more detailed description of the Services through published software libraries, documentation, and additional resources we make available to you on our website or within the Services (collectively, "Documentation").\par
\par
Wherever used in these Terms, "you", "your" or similar terms means the person or legal entity accessing or using the Services. If you are accessing or using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms, and "you" and "your" will refer to that entity.\par
\par
\b BY REGISTERING FOR, ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THESE TERMS IN THEIR ENTIRETY AND THAT YOU AGREE TO ENTER A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT WITH CELLM. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT REGISTER FOR, ACCESS, OR USE THE SERVICES.\b0\par
\par
Cellm reserves the right to modify, supplement or replace these Terms. We will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any material changes (e.g., via email or a notification through the Services), effective upon posting the changes on our website or notifying you otherwise as specified in Section 11.7. Your continued use of the Services after such modifications become effective constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using the Services and cancel your account according to Section 7.2. You are responsible for regularly reviewing the current version of the Terms.\par
\par
You may not access or use any Services unless you agree to abide by all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement. If you do not understand any of the terms of this Agreement, please contact us before using the Services. You can contact us at legal@getcellm.com.\par
\par
\b 1. The Services\par
\b0\par
\b 1.1 Your Cellm Account\par
1.1.1. Registration\b0\par
To register for a Cellm Account and use certain Services, you or the person submitting the application (your "Representative") must provide us with required information, such as your email address. For paid subscription plans, you must also provide valid payment information. You must provide accurate and complete information and keep your account information updated.\par
\par
You affirm to Cellm that your Representative is authorized to provide the information required for registration and ongoing use of the Services on your behalf and to bind you to these Terms. We may require you to provide additional information or documentation verifying your identity or demonstrating your Representative's authority. Without the express written consent of Cellm, you may not register or attempt to register for a Cellm Account on behalf of a user Cellm previously terminated from use of the Services due to a breach of this Agreement.\par
\par
\b 1.1.2. Account Security\b0\par
You are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials (like passwords) and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify Cellm immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. Cellm is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your account credentials.\par
\par
\b 1.1.3. Consent to Electronic Disclosures and Notices\b0\par
By registering for a Cellm Account, you agree that such registration constitutes your electronic signature, and you consent to the electronic provision of all disclosures, notices, documents, and other communications from Cellm ("Notices"), including those required by law. You agree that your electronic consent has the same legal effect as a physical signature. You agree that Cellm can provide Notices to you through our website, or by emailing them to the email address you provided for your Cellm Account. You must maintain an accurate email address with us. Electronic Notices have the same meaning and effect as if we provided you with paper Notices.\par
\par
\b 1.2 Subscription Plans\b0\par
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Cellm shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with the Services selected in your Subscription Plan. The Services may be available without an account, or with an account on a free or paid subscription basis. At the time of registration for an account requiring a subscription, you must select a plan detailing the specific Services to be provided, usage limits ("Scope of Use"), applicable fees, and payment terms (the "Subscription Plan").\par
\par
\b 1.3 Updates and Functionalities\b0\par
You acknowledge that Cellm may update the Services from time to time, and such updates may result in changes in the appearance and/or functionality (including adding, modifying, or removing features or content). Cellm will provide reasonable notice if such changes materially decrease the core functionality of the Services for which you have a paid subscription. Without limiting the foregoing, Cellm may, in its sole discretion and upon reasonable notice where feasible, change the functionality associated with certain Subscription Plans, including potentially discontinuing Services offered on a free basis.\par
\par
\b 1.4 Permitted Uses\b0\par
You are responsible for your own conduct and any data you process while using the Services. You agree to use the Services only for lawful purposes and in a manner consistent with these Terms, the Documentation, and any applicable rules, policies, and guidelines established by Cellm. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services complies with all applicable laws and regulations.\par
\par
Misuse or unauthorized use of the Services, related systems, or networks, or any information available through them, is strictly prohibited. Cellm reserves the right, at its sole discretion, without liability and without prejudice to other remedies, to immediately suspend or terminate access by any user who is using, or who Cellm reasonably believes is using, the Services in violation of these Terms, particularly if such use poses a security risk, violates the law, or negatively impacts other users or the Services.\par
\par
\b 1.5 Prohibited Uses\b0\par
Without limiting Section 1.4, you agree not to use the Services to: (i) engage in conduct that would constitute a criminal or quasi-criminal offence, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable local, national, or international law or regulation, or accepted Internet protocol; (ii) communicate, transmit, upload or post information that is illegal, inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, false, defamatory, or libellous; (iii) communicate, transmit, upload or post information or material that infringes intellectual property rights, privacy rights, rights of publicity, or any other rights of any person; (iv) communicate, transmit, upload or post material that is obscene, vulgar, pornographic, abusive, harassing, defamatory, threatening, racist, sexist, discriminatory, or otherwise objectionable; (v) attempt to interfere with or gain unauthorized access to the Services or its related systems or networks (including probing, scanning, or testing vulnerability); (vi) advertise, solicit or promote the sale or distribution of products or services competitive with Cellm, without Cellm's prior written consent; (vii) use or attempt to use the Services to gain unauthorized access to any person's data or network; (viii) transmit any material that contains software viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or other harmful or disruptive computer code, files, or programs; or (ix) otherwise use the Services in a manner that could, in Cellm's reasonable opinion, adversely affect the ability of other users to use the Services or the Internet.\par
\par
\b 1.6 Third-Party Products and Services\b0\par
The Services may enable you to access, interact with, or purchase products or services provided by third parties, including via links from the Services ("Third-Party Services"). Cellm provides access to Third-Party Services only as a convenience. Such access does not imply any warranties, representations, endorsements, approvals, or verification by Cellm. You acknowledge that the use of Third-Party Services is governed solely by the terms and conditions between you and the third-party provider, and Cellm is not responsible for, and makes no representations regarding, such Third-Party Services. You use Third-Party Services at your own risk.\par
\par
\b 1.7 Access to Services\b0\par
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and your compliance therewith, Cellm grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to access and use the Services during the applicable Subscription Term in accordance with this Agreement, your applicable Subscription Plan (including the Scope of Use), and the Documentation. If Cellm offers client software (e.g., a desktop or mobile application) for any Service, you may use such software solely in connection with the authorized use of the Service, subject to the terms herein. You acknowledge that the Services are online, subscription-based products, and Cellm may modify them pursuant to Section 1.3.\par
\par
\b 1.8 Subscription Terms and Renewals\b0\par
Services are provided on a subscription basis for the term specified in your Subscription Plan ("Subscription Term"). Unless otherwise specified in your Subscription Plan or cancelled by you in accordance with Section 7.2, your subscription will automatically renew for additional periods equal in duration to the initial Subscription Term. You will be charged the applicable subscription fees at the then-current rates (unless otherwise agreed) using the payment method on file. You may cancel your subscription renewal through your account settings prior to the renewal date. If you cancel your subscription, it will terminate at the end of the then-current Subscription Term, and you are not entitled to refunds except as required by law or expressly stated in this Agreement (e.g., Section 7.2).\par
\par
If you change your Subscription Plan (e.g., upgrade or downgrade) mid-term, the change may take effect immediately or at the start of the next billing cycle, as specified during the change process. Prorated charges or credits may apply as described at the time of the change.\par
\par
\b 1.9 Your Data\b0\par
"Your Data" means any data, content, code, software, text, images, video, or other materials of any type that you (or your users) upload, submit, or otherwise transmit to or through the Services. You retain all right, title, and interest in and to Your Data in the form provided to Cellm. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you hereby grant Cellm and its authorized third-party service providers a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable right and license to host, copy, transmit, display, modify, and create derivative works of Your Data, but only as reasonably necessary to provide, maintain, and improve the Services. Cellm may also access your account or instance solely to respond to your support requests or address technical issues.\par
\par
\b 1.10 Security\b0\par
Cellm implements reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect Your Data from accidental loss and unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. However, you understand that use of the Services involves transmission of Your Data over networks not owned, operated, or controlled by Cellm, and we are not responsible for any of Your Data lost, altered, intercepted, or stored across such networks. We cannot guarantee that our security procedures will be error-free, that transmissions of Your Data will always be secure, or that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers. You are responsible for configuring and using the Services securely.\par
\par
\b 1.11 Resource Limits\b0\par
Your use of the Services is subject to the resource and rate limits specified in your Subscription Plan ("Scope of Use"). You may not attempt to bypass or exceed these limits. While we may offer some flexibility or attempt to contact you if limits are approached or exceeded, we reserve the right, if we deem action necessary due to your violation of these limits or this Agreement, or if we detect attempts to bypass limits, to: (1) throttle your usage or (2) suspend your access to the Services. We will generally provide notice before taking such action and allow a reasonable opportunity to resolve the issue, unless we determine in good faith that your actions endanger the operation of the Service, other users, or pose a security risk, in which case we may suspend access immediately without notice. Cellm has no liability for actions taken as described in this section. Cellm may impose new or modify existing resource limits with or without notice to you.\par
\par
\b 1.12 Duplicate Accounts\b0\par
You may not create duplicate accounts for the purpose of circumventing usage limits, extending trial periods, or violating these Terms. If you require a trial extension, please contact our support team. Upon detection of duplicate accounts used in violation of this policy, we may suspend or terminate all associated accounts immediately without notice. Cellm has no liability for actions taken as described in this section.\par
\par
\b 1.13 Responsibility for Your Data\par
1.13.1 General\b0\par
You must ensure that your use of the Services and all of Your Data complies at all times with these Terms and all applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations ("Laws"), including Data Protection Legislation (as defined in Section 12). You represent and warrant that: (i) you have obtained all necessary rights, releases, consents, and permissions to provide all Your Data to Cellm and to grant the rights granted to Cellm in this Agreement; and (ii) Your Data, its transfer to Cellm, and its use by Cellm as authorized by you under this Agreement do not violate any Laws (including those relating to export control, electronic communications, and data privacy) or rights of any third party (including intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or rights of publicity), and any use, collection, and disclosure authorized herein is not inconsistent with the terms of any applicable privacy policies or notices you provide to individuals. Cellm assumes no responsibility or liability for Your Data, and you are solely responsible for Your Data and the consequences of using, disclosing, storing, or transmitting it via the Services.\par
\par
\b 1.13.2 Sensitive Data and High-Risk Activities\b0\par
You agree not to submit to the Services (or use the Services to collect or process): (i) any "special categories of personal data" under GDPR (Art. 9) or similar sensitive data under other Data Protection Legislation (e.g., health data, biometric data, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, data concerning sex life or sexual orientation), unless expressly permitted by Cellm for a specific feature and subject to additional terms; (ii) any patient, medical, or other protected health information regulated by specific health data privacy laws (like HIPAA in the US), unless pursuant to a separate written agreement with Cellm specifically covering such use; (iii) any sensitive financial information like full credit card numbers (except where entered directly into a secure payment processor interface integrated with Cellm) or bank account details (other than for billing purposes as agreed); or (iv) any other information subject to specific, heightened regulation or protection under Laws where the Service is not designed or designated for such purpose (collectively, "Sensitive Data"). You acknowledge that Cellm is not intended for processing Sensitive Data unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing, and Cellm has no liability under this Agreement for Sensitive Data processed in violation of this Section. The Services are not intended for use in high-risk activities where failure could lead to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage.\par
\par
\b 1.13.3 Indemnity for Your Data\b0\par
You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Cellm, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or relating to any third-party claim concerning Your Data, including but not limited to claims that Your Data, or your use of the Services in breach of this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights or violates the privacy rights of a third party or violates applicable Law. This indemnification obligation is subject to Cellm: (i) promptly notifying you in writing of the claim; (ii) granting you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (provided you do not settle in a manner that admits liability or imposes obligations on Cellm without its prior written consent); and (iii) providing reasonable cooperation to you in the defense and settlement of the claim, at your expense.\par
\par
\b 1.13.4 Removals and Suspension\b0\par
Cellm has no obligation to monitor Your Data. However, if we become aware of Your Data or your use of the Service violating this Agreement (including Section 1.5 or 1.13.2), applicable Law, or third-party rights, or in response to takedown requests (e.g., valid DMCA notices or equivalent), we may, without liability: (1) remove the relevant Your Data from the Services or (2) suspend your access to the Services. We will generally provide notice and an opportunity to cure, where feasible, but may act immediately without notice if we reasonably determine that the violation endangers the Service, other users, or poses a legal or security risk. We have no liability for actions taken as described in this section.\par
\par
\b 1.13.5 Data Retention and Deletion\b0\par
We remove Your Data from our systems when you delete your account according to the procedures outlined in our Privacy Policy and subject to Section 12 (GDPR) and applicable Law. Typically, active data is removed promptly upon account deletion, while backups may be retained for a limited period (e.g., up to 90 days) for disaster recovery purposes before being permanently deleted. Cellm cannot recover Your Data once it has been permanently deleted.\par
\par
\b 2. Intellectual Property\par
2.1 Ownership of Cellm IP\b0\par

\par
You may not: (i) claim or register ownership of Cellm IP on your behalf or on behalf of others; (ii) sublicense any rights in Cellm IP granted by us; (iii) import or export any Cellm IP to a person or country in violation of any country's export control Laws; (iv) use Cellm IP in a manner that violates this Agreement or Laws; or (v) attempt to do any of the foregoing.\par
