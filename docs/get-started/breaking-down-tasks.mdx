# How to Break Down Tasks for AI

## Why Task Breakdown Matters

To get the most out of Cellm, it’s important to break your business tasks into clear, manageable steps. This helps the AI understand what you want, and increases the chances of getting useful results. If a task is too broad or too complex, even the largest models may struggle. If it’s too simple, you may not be using the AI’s capabilities effectively.

## Decomposing Business Tasks: Examples

**Too Simple:**
- "Summarize this sentence."

**Too Complex:**
- "Analyze this spreadsheet, find all errors, suggest improvements, and write a summary report."

**Just Right:**
- "Find errors in this spreadsheet."
- "Suggest improvements for this spreadsheet."
- "Write a summary report based on these findings."

Break down big tasks into a sequence of smaller prompts. This makes it easier for the AI to help you, and for you to review the results at each step.

## Choosing the Right Model Size

Cellm offers three model sizes for each provider:
- **Small:** Fast and cost-effective. Great for simple tasks like summarization, extracting data, or basic text generation.
- **Medium:** Good for moderately complex tasks, such as multi-step reasoning or more nuanced text generation.
- **Large:** Best for complex tasks that require deep understanding, creativity, or handling large amounts of information. Use with care—these models are slower and more expensive.

**Tip:** Start with a Small or Medium model. Only use Large models if you need to.

## What AI Can and Can’t Do

**AI Can:**
- Summarize, rewrite, or extract information from text
- Generate simple reports or lists
- Help brainstorm ideas
- Answer questions based on provided data

**AI Can’t:**
- Access real-time or external data not provided in your prompt
- Perform complex, multi-step reasoning reliably
- Guarantee 100% accuracy or up-to-date knowledge
- Replace expert judgment for critical business decisions

## Best Practices
- Start with a clear, specific prompt
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps
- Use the smallest model that gets the job done
- Review and edit AI output before using it
- Iterate: refine your prompts based on results

## Common Pitfalls
- Overloading a single prompt with too many tasks
- Expecting the AI to know things you haven’t provided
- Using vague or ambiguous language
- Not matching model size to task complexity
- Not reviewing AI-generated content
