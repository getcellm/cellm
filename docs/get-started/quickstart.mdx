## Quick Install
You can try out Cellm in a single Excel session without having to [Install](install) it:

1. Go to the [Github Release page](https://github.com/getcellm/cellm/releases) and download `Cellm-AddIn64-packed.xll` and `appsettings.json`. Put them in the _same_ folder.

2. Double-click on `Cellm-AddIn64-packed.xll` and click on "Enable this add-in for this session only" when Excel opens. 

3. Download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Cellm will automatically instruct Ollama to download Gemma 2 2B the first time you call `=PROMPT()`.

See the [Install](install.mdx) page for instructions on how install Cellm.

<Tip>
  Cellm requires Windows 10 or higher, [Excel 2010 or higher ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) (desktop app), and [.NET 9.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0).
</Tip>

## Usage
Select a cell and type e.g. `=PROMPT("What model are you and who made you?")`. The default model will tell you that is called "Gemma" and made by Google DeepMind.

You can also use cell references to dynamically change your prompts based on other data in your spreadsheet. For example, try to copy a news article into cell A1 and type in the formula of cell B1 `=PROMPT(A1, "Extract all person names mentioned in the text")`. 

You can also use the built-in tools to analyse files on your disk. Fill out a folder path in cell A1 and type in cell A2 `=PROMPT(A1, "Which pdf files do I have in my downloads folder?")`. Gemma 2 2B does not support tool calling, so for this task you must use another model, e.g. OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini`.

# Configuration
Use the Cellm tab in Excel's ribbon menu to configure which AI model to use.

- **Model**: Select which AI model to use (e.g., "openai/gpt-4o-mini"). The dropdown gives a couple of preset options. You can also type the model name directly in the drop-down text field to select another model.
- **Address**: The API endpoint for your chosen provider (e.g., "https://api.openai.com/v1")
- **API Key**: Your authentication key for the selected provider

The other options in the Cellm tab are:
- **Cache**: Enable/disable local caching of model responses to a fixed input. Useful when Excel triggers recalculation of many cells.
- **Functions**: Enable/disable function calling.
