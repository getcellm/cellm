## Quick Install
You can quickly try out Cellm in a single Excel session:

1. Go to the [Github Release page](https://github.com/getcellm/cellm/releases) and download `Cellm-AddIn64-packed.xll` and `appsettings.json`. Put them in the _same_ folder.

2. Double-click on `Cellm-AddIn64-packed.xll` and click on "Enable this add-in for this session only" when Excel opens. 

3. Download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). The first time Cellm will automatically instruct Ollama to download Gemma 2 2B the first time you call `=PROMPT()`.

See the [Install](install.mdx) page for instructions on how install Cellm as proper Cellm extension.

<Tip>
  Cellm requires Windows 10 or higher, [Excel 2010 or higher ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) (desktop app), and [.NET 9.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0).

## Usage

### Sending a prompt to a model
Select a cell and type e.g. `=PROMPT("What model are you and who made you?")`. The default model will tell you that is called "Gemma" and made by Google DeepMind.

### Processing text in cells
You can use cell references to dynamically change your prompts based on other data in your spreadsheet. For example, try to copy a news article into cell A1 and type in the formula of cell B1 `=PROMPT(A1, "Extract all person names mentioned in the text")`. 

### Function Calling
You can use the built-in tools to analyse files on your disk. Fill out a folder path in cell A1 and type in cell A2 `=PROMPT(A1, "Which pdf files do I have in my downloads folder?")`. Gemma 2 2B does not support tool calling, so for this task you must use another model, e.g. OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini`.

- **Model**: Select which AI model to use (e.g., "openai/gpt-4o-mini"). The dropdown gives a couple of preset options. You can also type the model name directly in the drop-down text field to select another model.
- **Address**: The API endpoint for your chosen provider (e.g., "https://api.openai.com/v1")
- **API Key**: Your authentication key for the selected provider

The other options in the Cellm tab are:
- **Cache**: Enable/disable local caching of model responses to a fixed input. Useful when Excel triggers recalculation of many cells.
- **Functions**: Enable/disable function calling.
