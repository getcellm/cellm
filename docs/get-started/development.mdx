This guide will walk you through the build process step by step.

## Build with command line

1. Clone this repository:
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/getcellm/cellm.git
   ```

2. In your terminal, navigate to the root of the project directory:
   ```cmd
   cd cellm
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```cmd
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```cmd
   dotnet build --configuration Debug
   ```

Once the build is complete, you load Cellm into Excel:

1. Navigate to the output folder `src/Cellm/bin/net9.0-windows/publish/`

2. Double-click `Cellm-AddIn64-packed.xll`

Excel will open with Cellm ready to use test.

### Troubleshooting

If the build fails, here are some common things you can try:

- Make sure you have .NET 9.0 SDK installed (not just the runtime). You can verify your .NET installation by running dotnet --version in your terminal.
- Try running `dotnet clean` followed by `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build` again.
- Check that you're in the correct directory (cellm folder).

## Build with Visual Studio

1. In Visual Studio, go to File > Clone Repository.
 
2. Set the Repository Location to `https://github.com/getcellm/cellm`, the Path to a directory of your choice, and click Clone.

3. Run the "Excel" configuration. Visual Studio will build Cellm and open Excel. Click on "Enable this add-in for this session only" to load the build into Excel.

All Visual Studio's usual debugging tools works when you run the "Excel" configuration. You can set breakpoints, inspect runtime variables, and view log messages in the Output window.

## Build the installer

1. Copy `src/Cellm.Installers/Cellm.Installer.wixproj.user.sign` to `src/Cellm.Installers/Cellm.Installer.wixproj.user` and set `CERTIFICATE_PATH` and `CERTIFICATE_PATH`. Don't just rename the file. It is tracked by git and you risk committing your sensitive information later.

2. In Visual Studio, select the `Release` configuration and build the `Cellm.Installer` target. 

You need the Windows 10 SDK or Windows 11 SDK which includes the sign tool. If you get errors about `signtool.exe` not being found, run the Visual Studio Installer and modify your Visual Studio installation to include one of these SDKs.
