## What is Cellm?

Cellm is an Excel extension that lets you use Large Language Models (LLMs) in cell formulas. Cellm is useful when you want to use AI for repetitive tasks that would normally require copy-pasting data in and out of a chat window many times. 

For example, you can write `=PROMPT("Extract all person names mentioned in the text", A1)` in a formula and drag the cell to apply the prompt to many rows. Cellm's `=PROMPT()` function will output the AI response to a range of text, similar to how Excel's =SUM() function outputs the sum of a range of numbers.

## Where did Cellm come from?

A friend of ours was writing a systematic review paper. She had to compare 7,500 papers against inclusion and exclusion criterias. We figured this was a great use case for LLMs but quickly realized that individually copying 7,500 papers in and out of chat windows was a total pain. This sparked the idea to make an AI tool to automate repetitive tasks for people like her who would rather avoid programming.

We think Cellm is really cool because it enables everyone to automate repetitive tasks with AI to a level that was previously available only to programmers.

## How does it work?
Cellm adds a few fundamental features to Excel that you can use to combine AI text processing with normal Excel functions:

- Call AI models with the `=PROMPT()` function that outputs model responses directly in cells.
- `=PROMPT()` behaves like a normal Excel function. Prompts can reference other cells, re-run when inputs change, and outputs can be filtered, plotted, and used in other Excel formulas.
- Outputs with multiple values can spill into rows and colums, making it easy to build workflows that batch process your data.
- Cellm supports models from Anthropic, AWS, Azure, Google, Mistral, OpenAI, and others as well as local models via Llamafiles, Ollama, or vLLM.


## How do I get started?
You [download the installer](https://github.com/getcellm/cellm/releases/download/v0.4.0/Cellm-AddIn-Release-x64.msi) and run it. Cellm will be available the next time you start Excel. As Cellm is just an Excel add-in, its extremely easy to get started. If you know how to use Excel's `=SUM()` function, you will quickly get the hang of Cellm's `=PROMPT()` function.
