## Install
To install Cellm:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the installer">
    Go to the [Github Release page](https://github.com/getcellm/cellm/releases) and download the latest `Cellm-AddIn-Release-x64.msi`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the installer">
    During installation, Cellm will download Node.js that it needs for MCP servers. Make sure you're connected to the internet during installation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install Ollama to use local models (optional)">
  <Info>
    If you want to use the more powerful hosted models right away, you can skip this step. The [Hosted Models](/models/hosted-models) section shows you how.
  </Info>

  To get started with local models, we recommend you try out the Gemma 3 4B model with quantized aware training. Gemma 3 4B is a wonderful little model that will run fine on your CPU, ensuring no data ever leaves your computer. And it's free.

  1. Download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Ollama will start after the install and automatically run whenever you start up your computer.
  2. Open the Windows Terminal, type `ollama pull gemma3:4b-it-qat` and hit Enter.
  3. Open Excel and type `=PROMPT("What model are you and who made you?")`. The model will respond that is is Gemma 3 and made by Google.
</Accordion>

## Upgrade
When a new version of Cellm is released, simply repeat the installation steps above with the latest installer.
