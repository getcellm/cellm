    <Info>
      If you want to use the more powerful hosted models right away, you can skip this step. The [Hosted Models](#models) section shows you how.
    </Info>

    To get started, we recommend you try out the Gemma 2 2B model. 

    1. Download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Ollama will start after the install and automatically run whenever you start up your computer.
    2. In Excel, select a cell and type out the formulas `=PROMPT("Which model are you and who made you?")`. The model will tell you that is called "Gemma" and made by Google DeepMind.

    Gemma 2 2B is a wonderful little model will run fine on your CPU, ensuring no data ever leaves your computer. And its free. Who knows, perhaps you will also discover the joy of running open source LLMs on your own machine!

    <Tip>
      Cellm will automatically instruct Ollama to download Gemma 2 2B the first time you call `=PROMPT()`. The first prompt will therefore take a while.
