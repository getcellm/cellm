description: 'Use LLMs in Excel formulas'

## Dos And Don'ts
Do:

- Experiment with different prompts to find the most effective instructions for your data.
- Use cell references to dynamically change your prompts based on other data in your spreadsheet.
- Use local models for sensitive and confidential data.
- Refer to the cell data as "context" in your instructions.
- Verify at least a subset of a model's responses. Models will make errors and rely entirely on your input, which may also contain errors.

Don't:

- Don't use Cellm to compute sums, averages, and other numerical calculations. The current generation of LLMs are not designed for mathematical operations. Use Excel's existing functions instead.
- Don't use cloud model providers to process sensitive or confidential data.
- Don't use extremely long prompts or give Cellm complex tasks. A normal chat UI lets you have a back and forth conversation which is better for exploring complex topics.
- Don't use Cellm for tasks that require up-to-date information beyond the AI model's knowledge cutoff date _unless_ you provide the information as context.
