Function Calling allows Cellm to interact with external tools and data, like searching files on your disk and reading their contents. When enabled, the model can dynamically call functions to retrieve relevant data before responding. Combined with Excels other formulas, function calling makes Cellm a powerful low-code automation tool.

## Enabling function calling
To allow models to call external functions, open the **Cellm** ribbon in Excel and check the functions you want to enable:

- **Internet Browser**: Let the model access web pages.
- **File Search**: Let the model search for files om your computer.
- **File Reader**: Let the model read text files on your computer, such as code or PDFs.

## Calling a function
When function calling is enabled, you can write prompts that leverage these functions. You can explicitly ask the model to use a specific function in or prompt or leave to the model to decide when to use it.

### Example 1: Searching for Files

```excel
=PROMPT.TOCOLUMN("Which PDF files do I have in the folder C:\Users\username\Invoices?")
```

With **File Search** enabled the model will first ask Cellm to run a function that finds all PDF files in your download folder. Cellm performs the search and sends the result back to the model, and the model uses this list to generate its actual response.

### Example 2: Classifying PDF files
```excel
=PROMPT(A1, "If the PDF is a recurring invoice, respond with 'SUBSCRIPTION', otherwise respond with "ONE-TIME PAYMENT")
```
If **File Reader** is enabled, the model will ask Cellm to run a function that extracts text from the PDF. Cellm reads the file and sends the result back to the model, and the model uses the text to respond with the class.

You can drag the prompt down across all rows to classify all files.

## Dos and Don'ts
### Do:
- **Be specific:** Clearly tell the model which function to use and what to do. Instead of a vague prompt like "Analyze my invoices," guide it with `"Summarize the PDF file at C:\Invoices\inv-123.pdf"`.
- **Use cell references for dynamic workflows:** Put file paths or search queries in separate cells and reference them in your prompt (e.g., `=PROMPT(A1, "Summarize this file")`). This lets you drag formulas down to process hundreds of files at once.
- **Enable functions only when needed:** For security and performance, only activate the functions required for your current task. Disable them when you're finished.

### Don't:
- **Don't grant access to sensitive data with cloud models:** Avoid using functions like **File Reader** or **File Search** on confidential documents if you are using a cloud-based AI model (like from OpenAI or Google). Use local models for privacy-sensitive tasks.
- **Don't write vague prompts:** Avoid ambiguous requests like `"find the report"` if you have multiple reports. The more precise your prompt, the more reliable the result.
