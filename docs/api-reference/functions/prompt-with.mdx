```excel
PROMPTWITH(providerAndModel: string or cell, cells: range | instruction: string, [instruction: range or string | temperature: double], [temperature: double]): string
```

Allows you to call a model from a cell formula and specify the model as the first argument. This overides the default model.

- **providerAndModel (Required)**: A string on the form "provider/model".
  - Default: ollama/gemma2:2b
- **cells (Required):** A cell or a range of cells.
  - The model will use the cells as context and follow any instructions as long as they are present _somewhere_ in the cells. If you provide an instruction as second argument, the second argument instructions takes precedence.
- **instructions (Optional):** A cell, a range of cells, or a string.
  - The model will follow these instructions and ignore instructions in the cells of the first argument.
  - Default: Empty. 
- **temperature (Optional):** double. 
    - A value between 0 and 1 that controls the balance between deterministic outputs and creative exploration. Lower values make the output more deterministic, higher values make it more random.
  - Default: 0. The model will almost always give you the same result.
- **Returns:** The AI model's response as plain text.

Example usage:

- `=PROMPT("openai/gpt-4o-mini", A1:D10, "Extract keywords")` will use GPT-4o mini to extract keywords from the cells.
- `=PROMPT("openai/gpt-4o-mini", A1:D10, "Extract keywords", 0.7)` will use GPT-4o minito extract keywords from the cells and use a temperature of 0.7.
- `=PROMPT("openai/gpt-4o-mini", A1:D10)` will use GPT-4o mini to process the range of cells and follow instructions as long as they present _somewhere_ in the cells.
- `=PROMPT("openai/gpt-4o-mini", A1:D10, 0.7)` will use GPT-4o mini to process the selected range of cells, follow any instruction within the cells, and use a temperature of 0.7.
