Cellm supports hosted models from Anthropic, AWS, Azure, DeepSeek, Google, OpenAI, Mistral, and any OpenAI-compatible cloud provider. These models are more powerful than anything you can run on your own computer.

<Warning>
  AI providers use data from free tiers and even some consumer plans to improve their models. Review each provider's data usage policies before sending sensitive information. For contractual data privacy guarantees, consider [local models](/models/local-models) or [Cellm's subscription plans](https://getcellm.com/pricing).
</Warning>

## Model sizes
We split hosted models into three tiers based on their size and capabilities, balancing speed, intelligence, and problem-solving skills:

|                   | Small Model                                                                                                           | Medium Model                                                                                                        | Large Model                                                                                                         |
